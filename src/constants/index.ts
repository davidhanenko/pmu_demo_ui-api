      'Before beginning the Powder Brows procedure, we prioritize a thorough consultation to understand your desired outcome and ensure your complete satisfaction. Our expert artist will evaluate your facial features, including skin tone, hair color, and face shape, to create a customized design that suits you best. Together, we will determine the ideal shape, fullness, and color for your new brows.',

    title: 'Numbing and Preparation',
    description:
      'On the day of the procedure, our artist will apply a topical numbing cream to ensure your comfort throughout the process. Once the numbing takes effect, we will meticulously cleanse and prepare the brow area, removing any excess oils or residues. Our commitment to hygiene and safety means we use only disposable, single-use tools and the highest quality pigments.',

    title: 'Powder Brows Application',
    description:
      'Using a specialized technique, our artist will gently implant tiny dots of pigment into the superficial layers of the skin. This creates a soft, powdery effect that mimics the appearance of filled-in brows. The process involves building layers of color to achieve the desired density and shape. Our skilled artist will ensure precision and attention to detail, resulting in natural-looking, symmetrical brows.',

    title: 'Aftercare and Touch-Ups',
    description:
      'After the procedure, we will provide you with detailed aftercare instructions to optimize the healing process. It is normal to experience some mild redness and slight scabbing during the initial healing period. Over the next few weeks, your brows will gradually lighten and settle into their final color. We recommend a touch-up session after 4-6 weeks to perfect the results and extend the longevity of your Powder Brows.',
